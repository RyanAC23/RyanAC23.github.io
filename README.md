# RyanAC23.github.io

Archival site rescued from geocities.


<b>To Do:</b>
* make new page, update history. Find a way to itemize entries and come up with
a script that auto displays the five most recent of these on the front page.

* put dotfiles in new repo and link to it. Site should contain my full setup instructions for
  installing ubuntu-mate and archlinux from scratch, as well as a separate section explainin my
  jupyter notebook workflow.
* a script auto updating packages in apt / conda, and then running autoremove / clean -p, would be
  neat.
