    Nice try! Personal information online is how adults find and kidnap you!<br>
    <p>I was born at some ever more distant time and in some high latitude place. I learned to walk and moved to a mid latitude location
      which was much hotter than where I started off. After some time passed my family
      split the difference in latitude and we settled roughly where I am now.</p>
    <p>Far too many things interest me, so a source of progress in the last few years has been identifying things that do NOT interest me, and making
      sure that I have nothing to do with them. Most don't have this kind of ability.</p>
