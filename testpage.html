  Let's test a few <STRONG>Ancient</STRONG> html formatting <EM>tags.</EM>
  <br>
  VAR: <VAR>antelope</VAR>
  <br>
  CODE: <CODE>#include < iostream ></CODE>
  <br>
  KBD: <KBD>ctrl + alt + del</KBD>
  <br>
  TT: <TT>as in, Typewriter.</TT> I don't think this one is supported in the real world.
  <br>
  PRE: <PRE>This one sounds similar to &lt;TT&gt;, but it appears to start on a new line.</PRE> Text after PRE appears below it.
  <br>
  What's the <B>difference</B> between <B>BOLD</B> and <STRONG>STRONG</STRONG>?
  <br>
  How about <I>ITALICS</I> and <EM>EMPHASIS</EM>?
  <p>I'm guessing the former replaced the latter at some point [in the future]</p>
  <br>
  <p>There is also a blockquote tag:</p>
  <blockquote><p>
    I was the shadow of the waxwing slain <br>
    by the false azure in the windowpane; <br>
    I was the smudge of ashen fluff-and I <br>
    Lived on, flew on, in the reflected sky. <br>
  </blockquote>
  Images alignment using <IMG SRC="./img/link-test.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=50 WIDTH=50 ALIGN="top"> align="top",
  <IMG SRC="./img/link-test.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=50 WIDTH=50 ALIGN="middle"> align="middle", and
  <IMG SRC="./img/link-test.jpg" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=50 WIDTH=50 ALIGN="bottom" ALT="ALT is for when an image doesn't want
  to load. Use TITLE for mouseover text."> align="bottom".
    <p>"top" doesn't appear to be working. <STRIKE>Watch out, because your ./ relative image references are a clear anachronism.</STRIKE>
    No! Graham's 1995 <EM>HTML Sourcebook</EM> uses this form of reference, so it's 100% genuine in this context!</p>
    <p>Graham also wants you to keep images under 10 kilobytes. webmaster [at] www.domain.name! </p>
    <p>Idea: make your jupyter notebook directories flat, so that each displays in order and you can generate a bar that looks 
      like [index][up][back][next], etc.</p>
    <PRE>You can use pre for
            PRE formatted and
              full width text
                instead of messing around
                  with html spacing</PRE>

    <p>Here's another style you can do - an input field</p>
    <p><INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="signature" VALUE="Polly wants a cracker" SIZE=60></p>
    <p> A bigger box:</p>
    <p><TEXTAREA NAME="body" COLS=60 ROWS=8>
    None of these can do anything the way they're currently hosted, since I can only have
    static pages.

    <p>Special characters with &# 
    <p>For example, a name with &#233 would use special character 233, preceded by &#.
    <p>Left and right angle brackets with lt and gt: &lt &gt (no # for these)
    <p>This also works for <CODE>&amp;amp</CODE> and <CODE>&amp;quot</CODE></p>
    <p>Also try <sub>sub</sub> and <sup>sup</sup>!</p>
    <p><b>JARGON:</b>
    <UL>
      <LI>tag: commands within &lt; &gt; brackets</LI>
      <LI>element: Everything in between the brackets, <CODE>&lt;LI&gt;like this list element.&lt;/LI&gt;</CODE></LI>
      <LI>empty element: Any element that doesn't affect a block of text, and thus doesn't require closing (<CODE>p, img</CODE>)</LI>
      <LI>container: A name occasionally used for elements marking blocks of text.</LI>
      <LI>attributes: Modifiers to elements, such as <CODE>width=""</CODE>, which are often optional.</LI>
    </UL>
    <hr>
    <a href="home.html" target="main" TITLE="This will take you back to the home screen.">Hover over this!</a><br>
    <p>Mouseover text uses the historical TITLE attribute because it was originally intended to give you the title in the HEAD element of a new
      page, without loading it.
    
    <p>URLs only contain the bottom half of the ISO Latin-1 characters, encoded in hex as %xx. (this is because many electronic mail programs mishandle
       special ASCII characters.) </p>
