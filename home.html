		<LI><b>(17 Oct  95) </b>Not the greatest I've ever been at consistent updates... but I'm still going at it. There's a new secret file on this website that links to my setup config files now, so that I can quickly install a new machine and get it workable. The "computing" tab will probably be obliterated soon and replaced with my setup configuration instructions (it's nothing but clutter in my head, but needs to be retained.)
		<LI><b>(14 Sept 95) </b>Today's update was an under the hood rehaul, but nothing that should have been noticeable by the average visitor. Some dumb things have been removed from the computing page.
	        <LI><b>(29 Aug 95) </b>Not much is being added to the site today, but it seems like most of the terminal packages I've been playing with will be made obsolete by emacs + org mode. Perhaps I should use this mode to create a todo list and keep it here.</LI>
		<LI><b>(24 Aug 95) </b>More functional content changes today. The links page now has a few links, with formatting for categories going forward. Now if only I could find a good icon for each link... </LI>
		<LI><b>(23 Aug 95) </b>Today I started learning C. With some luck, I'll find inspiration on how to streamline the site as I work through basic tutorials.</LI>
		<LI><b>(21 Aug 95) </b>After an extended period of being worn down from all angles, I have begun to transition from Vim to Emacs. My notes on basic commands have been uploaded to the computer tab, and will be updated as I become more sophisticated.</LI>
		<LI><b>(13 Aug 95) </b>It's hard to believe since not much content has been released, but we've won a "Best Dang Webring" award! The certificate should arrive in the mail soon, and once it does I will be sure to scan it. Thank you for all your support!
		<LI><b>(11 Aug 95) </b>It's a medium sized update this week. Added a new page for storing the linux config files I use often. This page will probably have more helpful notes to myself in the future. Look forward to it.
		<LI><b>(06 Aug 95) </b>Site debut! I will be working to bring you new and exciting content over the next few months. Send me any suggestions you may have!<br>
